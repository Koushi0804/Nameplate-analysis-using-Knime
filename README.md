# Nameplate-analysis-using-Knime
First, install Knime and then install the necesssary deep learning package in Knime.
Then you can import the necessary workflow from the official knime platform.
Here I have used CNN workflow for nameplate classification using images in knime.
To get the results we need to integrate python.
Two versions of python are required- python2 and python3.
We can integrate the python environment by using conda or it can be done manually.
Then by using the workflow, you can get the results.
